## ✨ Why ACE-AGI? (Value Proposition)

ACE-AGI is the flagship project of the AxiomHive ecosystem, dedicated to building a cognitive architecture where every decision, inference, and data transformation is auditable and traceable. We reject black-box models in favor of a proof-driven approach to AGI development.

- **🔍 Transparency in AGI:** A commitment to making the internal workings of the cognitive engine fully visible and understandable
- **✅ Verifiable Intelligence:** Utilizing integrity tools to cryptographically ensure the trustworthiness of the intelligence output
- **🧩 Modular Design:** Built to integrate seamlessly with other AxiomHive components (LexLab, WIN) to form a complete, sovereign computing stack
- **🌐 Open & Viral:** Community-driven development with transparent processes and collaborative innovation
- **🛡️ Trustworthy AI:** Proof-driven approach ensuring reliability for high-stakes applications

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Basic understanding of AGI concepts

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/ACE-AGI.git
cd ACE-AGI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Your First Cognitive Engine

```python
from ace_agi import CognitiveCore

# Initialize the auditable cognitive engine
engine = CognitiveCore(mode='transparent')

# Run inference with full audit trail
result = engine.process({
    'task': 'reasoning_example',
    'input': 'Your data here'
})

# View complete decision trail
print(result.output)
print(result.reasoning_steps)  # See how the engine arrived at the decision
print(result.audit_proof)  # Cryptographic verification of the process
```
