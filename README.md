# üß† ACE-AGI: Auditable Cognitive Engine - Artificial General Intelligence

**The Auditable Cognitive Engine (ACE) project, focused on developing a verifiable and transparent Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) framework.**

ACE-AGI is the flagship project of the AxiomHive ecosystem, dedicated to building a cognitive architecture where every decision, inference, and data transformation is auditable and traceable. We reject black-box models in favor of a proof-driven approach to AGI development.

## ‚ú® Why ACE-AGI? (Value Proposition)

*   **Transparency in AGI:** A commitment to making the internal workings of the cognitive engine fully visible and understandable.
*   **Verifiable Intelligence:** Utilizing integrity tools (like Axiomhive-Leete) to cryptographically ensure the trustworthiness of the intelligence output.
*   **Modular Design:** Built to integrate seamlessly with other AxiomHive components (LexLab, WIN) to form a complete, sovereign computing stack.
